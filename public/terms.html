    <p>TVAM is a reflection-based awareness tool designed to help users engage in self-inquiry and inner reflection. It is not a therapeutic, diagnostic, or advisory service, nor a substitute for mental-health or medical care. All content, interactions, and AI-generated reflections are provided for contemplative and educational purposes only.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility and Access</h2>
    <p>Access is by private invitation only as part of a closed proof-of-concept or product-market-fit (PMF) study. Users must be at least 18 years of age to participate. Access may be revoked at any time at the sole discretion of Begin Inwards, Inc.</p>

You are granted a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use the experience solely for personal, non-commercial, and evaluative purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy completely. Basic profile data (name, email, gender, age, and location) from Google sign-in via Firebase is collected only for authentication. This information is never disclosed, sold, or used for marketing. No chat, reflection, or input shared during a session is stored or retrievable.

    <h2>8. No Medical, Psychological, or Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>This platform and its AI responses do not provide medical, therapeutic, legal, or financial advice. They should not be relied upon to diagnose, treat, or make decisions regarding mental or physical health. If you are experiencing distress, crisis, or thoughts of self-harm, please contact your local emergency services or professional support immediately.</p>
